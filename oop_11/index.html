                                <p>Prime authors have been amazing to work with. This was my first publishing experience
                                    and they especially Chad has helped me throughout the whole thing. He had a lot of
                                    patience with me since everything was new and made the project flow smoothly. They
                                    were also very accommodating as well which was very helpful.

                                <p>Prime Authors helped me write my first book and I can say it was a great experience
                                    and I was walked through the process every step of the way. I do recommend prime
                                    authors to anyone seeking to have a book written and published.

                                <p>What a great experience I had. Sean Wright and his team walked me through the entire
                                    process before I signed up. And once they started working on my manuscript I knew, I
                                    am in right hands. They were open to the feedback and responded in timely manner.
                                    The cover was awesome and I loved the attention to detail. I am working on my second
                                    book and this time I dont have to search for a reliable publisher.

                                <p>I have found Prime Authors to be professional and respectful. They listen carefully
                                    to my requests and work to focus me in the direction of our goals. We are currently
                                    in the production stage of several things. Sometimes these things move slowly and
                                    one can get frustrated because we live in a "microwave" culture, but I'm certain
                                    that we will arrive at a successful finish.

                                <p>They are excellent at collaborating with the client to ensure that the book is what

                                    book and know how to help people who may not have experience in this type of work.
                                    They’re very proficient, and I would recommend them. I’ve been working with
                                    Primeauthors for my upcoming book, and they are amazing. They are quick, efficient,
                                    and very professional. I highly recommend them for any kind of writing work.
